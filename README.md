# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub account! Feel free to peruse and let me know what you think!

## Bio

My name is Skyler Riggle, and I'm currently a Computer Science student at the University of Oklahoma pursuing my accelerated Master's degree. For work I am currently employed at the K20 Center as a student programmer on their Game-Based Learning team. I've also recently accepted a position on the unergraduate research team for Dr. Song Fang at OU, where I will be participating in cybersecurity research.

As far as interests go, it's hard for me not to find something interesting in the world of technology. During my time in university, I've had the chance to touch everything from game engines, web applications, basic compilers, AI, and much more! Whether I'm working through the mathematical underpinnings or climbing the scaffolding of code holding together a program, I find joy in the ability to use my critical thinking skills to solve problems.

Outside of my work and studies, I enjoy tinkering on hobbiest wood-working and electronics projects. To cite an example, my family draws names each year so that each person is responsible to get one other person a Christmas gift. Each year I use my fun hobby to build and design fun adventures for my person to go on in order to receive their present. So if you ever need a conversation starter with me, I've got a few stories to tell!
